add test for positve/negative leap second on utc tuple
Dont just add 1 during pos leap, add true secs that passed
And handle fracsec properly
support leap seconds at a certain time during day as well

low prio:
add from iso date support to constructor of julgregbase
implement abstract base classes for fixedprec
