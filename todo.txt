continue parsing tzdb
find listing of mappings from timezone abbreviations to timezone full names

support for -00:00 offset as None
and include factory zone as result
use proper timezone names so that timeinstant to struct time doesnt have name of NULL (2 instances of this in code)

strptime support
add leap smear support
add a bunch of funcs like setdate get/set/increment taiyear/utchour, etc. for timeinstant and date classes as well (all return a new instance since immutable); or make replace function like datetime
complete all ... and notimplementederrors

low prio:
proper handling of "factory" timezone in tzdb
make some static methods underscore to show they are internal
error for out of bounds values in timeinstant from date tuple
datedelta from/to timedelta
support dst shifts that go across a year boundary
add leap second support to now
strftime & strptime add param for enabling custom flags like %f.6
add aliases from datetime library, maybe full compatibility class
simpledatetime/simpletimedelta wrapper around the date classes
  maybe holds a timezone value to use for setyear and stuff
support other timescales and julian dates in other timescales
  add microsoft epoch ticks, .net ticks
  add gps timescale to timescales list?
  ntp timestamps
    remove temp ntp timestamp code in auto leap seconds
  make all timescales except utc be derived from a list of offset, rate tuples; enables adding tcg, tcb, maybe time center galaxy and time comoving frame as well
  bonus is add ut1 timestamp funcs
fixedprec constructor handle real, integral
continue splitting timeinstant into many classes
split fixedprec into many classes
tests:
  timeinstant: tests for leap seconds during day
  timeinstant: test for passing in non-gregoriandate into to/from date tuple
  timeinstant: proper tests for timezone leapsecond, dst support
  timeinstant: test for fixed offset timezone support of pos/neg leap seconds

prob not doing:
add calendar functionality for isoweekdate
bump up max precision on the fixedprec on julian date calculations during calculation and reduce max prec to normal after
  default false option to do this
add default high detail tostring for tai and utc
timedelta/timeinstant from datetime/timedelta when doing math operations
datebase/datedelta from/to datetime.date when doing math operations
timeinstant: have _auto_reset_class_vars reset all other vars like julian date and TimeInstant static vars, or remove it to not reset the nominal vars
tests:
  date: monthly/yearly calendar generation funcs
