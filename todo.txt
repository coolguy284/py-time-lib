check random seeding on pytimelib tests
add leap smear support

jul/greg date:
  make dateDelta class for date subtraction
  add "xth thursday in month x" index func
timeinstant:
  add fixed-offset timezone support
  add seasonal-offset timezone support

add now method to timeinstant
  and replace datetime now in auto leap seconds
bump up max precision on the fixedprec on julian date calculations during calculation and reduce max prec to normal after
add a bunch of funcs like setdate get/set/increment taiyear/utchour, etc. for timeinstant and date classes as well (all return a new instance since immutable)
to make fixedprec hashable (only do if decimal is hashable) can make a reduce func that reduces a fixedprec to simplest form such that all reduced fixedprec that compare equal have same internal vars
  then make timedelta and timeinstant hashable, and also date classes
add support for default percentage time format strings
add default high detail tostring for tai and utc

low prio:
implement abstract base classes for fixedprec
add __r*__ versions for all fixedprec and timedelta ops
tests:
  timeinstant: tests for leap seconds during day
  timeinstant: test for passing in non-gregoriandate into to/from date tuple
possibly add strftime function and others to timeinstant (maybe only to the simplified wrapper classes)
add aliases from datetime library, maybe full compatibility class
simpledatetime/simpletimedelta wrapper around the date classes
bonus is add ut1 timestamp func
support other timescales and julian dates in other timescales
  add microsoft epoch ticks, .net ticks
  add gps timescale to timescales list?
  ntp timestamps
    remove temp ntp timestamp code in auto leap seconds
  make all timescales except utc be derived from a list of offset, rate tuples; enables adding tcg, tcb, maybe time comoving frame as well
add calendar functionality for isoweekdate
